# MemoryGame

MemoryGame - Messe 2.0   
Version 1.0  Date: 17 September 2015
An example of a simple Memory Game (match pairs) developed in the JavaScript IDE Webstorm with JavaScript (jQuery), HTML5 and CSS.

The game is based on a solution developed by Adam Khoury

# Modification
1. We changed the design (colors, sizes of field, images etc.)
2. Integration of images instead of letters from A-L
3. We developed:
   - a timer function to count the seconds, 
   - a counter function to count the unsuccessful attempts and
   - dialog boxes to ask about the field size, error handling (e.g enter unvalid number), information about the final score       and a question to play again.

# Bugs 

We'd like to say, for the record, that the game is not 100% finished. It's a very first version and there's room for a ton of improvements, optimizations, etc.

First Bug we found, but were not able to fix, is after the first dialogbox of field size question. If you enter another char instead of a number, the game will not start and no error handling will appear.

Also we tried to develop a function to upload images out of the img directory dynamically, but it didn't work. So if someone has a solution to fix it, we would be pleased to get the solution.
